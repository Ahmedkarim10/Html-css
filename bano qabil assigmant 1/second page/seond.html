    <h2>
        Research
    </h2>
    <p>
        Your content should reflect <i>factual, research-based information</i>. Companies that spread <b>false</b> or
        <b>misleading</b>
        information are vulnerable to backlash from both <small>search engines and consumers</small>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Business Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
        Think about the business goals you want to accomplish, and how you plan to use content to do this.

    </p>

    <h3><u>You should understand:</u></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>What type of content format you need.</li>
        <li> What style/tone you want your piece written in.</li>
        <li> What your goals are for each piece.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Buyer Persona
    </h2>
    <p>
        As our guide to creating a buyer persona notes, a buyer persona is an abstract depiction of your ideal customer.
        It is founded upon qualitative and quantitative data from market/competitor research and existing customer
        profiles.

    </p>
    <h2>
        Search Intent
    </h2>
    <p>
        Users often have very different expectations when using search engines, and, in its guidelines, Google talks a
        lot
        about how to understand what users are looking for when using different queries. Providing exhaustive
        answers to user queries increases the chances of your content being rated as quality.
    </p>
    <p>Search intent can be broken down into four distinct types:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>informational-</b> <i>the searcher is looking for specific information on a topic</i></li>
        <li><b>navigational-</b><i> the searcher is looking for a specific web page or site.</i> </li>
        <li><b>commerical-</b> <i>the searcher is considering a purchase and wants to investigate their optio</i></li>
        <li><b>transactional-</b><i>the searcher wants to purchase something.</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keyword Research and SEO </h2>
    <p>
        For a business, it’s important to remember that, in today’s digital era, content writing is closely aligned
        with SEO copywriting. Google and other search engines play a vital role in sending organic traffic to
        websites, and they value quality conten
    </p>

    <h2>
        Content Strategy
    </h2>
    <p>
        In order to effectively engage with your audience and outperform your competition’s marketing initiatives,it
        helps to construct a comprehensive content strategy plan. This plan refers to how you intend to manageyour
        marketing content (i.e. where and when you plan to publish). Your content strategy should include:
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>Your content formats <b>(i.e. social media posts, articles, etc.)</b></li>
        <li>The channels you will publish on <b>n (i.e. your business website, social media networks, etc.)</b></li>
        <li>How you will manage the conten <b>t (who will do the posting and manage the customer engagements)</b></li>
        <li>Content construction <b>(who will actually do the writing? If outsourcing, what firm will you use?)</b></li>
        <li>Content performanc <b>e (who will analyze how your content is performing and report back to you?)</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Topic Research

    </h2>
    <p>
        Take the time to carry out thorough topic research, so that you can come up with strong, strategic ideas
for your content that will resonate with your audience and drive results.
